## Description

This PHP project is a web shop that utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and PHP Data Objects (PDO) to manage products and orders.

Users can create, read, update, and delete products on the product management page. The product catalog page displays all products, including images. Users can add products to their cart and view, update, and remove items on the cart page. The checkout page provides a summary of the order and a button to complete the purchase. Additionally, there is a page displaying all completed orders.

The project uses PDO for database operations, and OOP principles for code organization, making it easy to understand and maintain.

## How to run the application

First run CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS web_shop; from the directory database to ensure the database creation, and afterward run createTables.php to create the required tables.
Start the localhost and afterward start enjoying the application!

## Enjoy!
